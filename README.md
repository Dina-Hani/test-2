## Project Objective
To analyze emergency room (ER) visits to understand patient demographics, satisfaction, and wait times, and identify patterns that can enhance service quality and operational efficiency.
## Questions (KPIs)
1- What is the total number of patients visiting the ER, and how are they categorized by age, gender, and visit type?
2- What are the average wait times and satisfaction scores across different demographic groups and referral departments?
3- How do patient visits vary across months, years, and week types (weekday vs. weekend)?
4- What is the distribution of administrative versus non-administrative patients?
5- Which departments handle the highest number of referrals, and how satisfied are patients with their services?
