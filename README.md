## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and report on emergency room (ER) patient visits
to understand patient demographics, satisfaction, and wait times, and identify patterns that can enhance service quality and operational efficiency.
## Dataset used
- <a href=  "https://github.com/Dina-Hani/test-2/blob/main/Patients%20ER%20Visits%20Dashboard%20Using%20Power%20Bi/Hospital%20ER.csv "    > Hospital ER Dataset csv file </a>
## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of patients visiting the ER, and how are they categorized by age, gender, and visit type?
- What are the average wait times and satisfaction scores across different demographic groups and referral departments?
- How do patient visits vary across months, years, and week types (weekday vs. weekend)?
- What is the distribution of administrative versus non-administrative patients?
- Which departments handle the highest number of referrals, and how satisfied are patients with their services?
##  Dashboard Interaction

## Process
- Data Gathering: Imported ER patient data for 2019â€“2020.
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: - Verify data for any missing and inconsistent values, and sort out the same.
- Data Visualization: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing KPIs and trends across demographics, time periods, and departments.
- Filtering Features: Added filters and slicers for analysis and comparative parameter selection (e.g., satisfaction score vs. wait time).
## Project Insight
- Patient Volume: The total number of ER patient visits is 9,216, with 41.41% being referred patients and 58.59% unreferred, most patients are adults (7,106 visits).
- Satisfaction Trends: The average satisfaction score is 5.47, with Pacific Islanders and Asian  showing the highest satisfaction in certain scenarios and 72.69% of patients did not provide a rating.
- Wait Times: Average wait time of 35.26 minutes, with some racial groups experiencing longer wait times than others. 
- Departmental Distribution: The majority of patient visits are in General Practice (1,840) the top-referred department, followed by Orthopedics (995), while departments like Renal and Gastroenterology manage fewer cases.
- Visit Trends: Weekdays have higher patient visits (6,574), with August being the busiest month (1,024 visits).
## Final conclusion
The analysis reveals key areas for improvement in ER operations, particularly in reducing wait times and increasing patient satisfaction. 
The data suggests that:
- Reducing wait times for underrepresented groups.
- Enhancing patient satisfaction, particularly in departments with lower ratings, through targeted quality improvement initiatives.
- Targeted interventions in specific departments and demographic groups could enhance overall patient experience.
- Continuous monitoring and data-driven strategies are recommended to sustain improvements and address emerging trends.
